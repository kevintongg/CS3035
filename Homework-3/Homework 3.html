<div class="container">
  <p>Pretty up your game from Homework 1.</p>

  <p>Before starting, make sure your game from homework 1 works.</p>

  <p>8 pts: Replace the use of prompt dialogs with buttons. Implement Up, Down, Left, and Right
    buttons.</p>

  <p>4 pts: Replace text (instructions, results) in prompts with text on web page.</p>

  <p>4 pts: Use jQuery to wrap all of your JavaScript in the document.ready callback.</p>

  <p>5 pts: Implement a map displaying where the explorer has already been, but not places where she
    hasn't been.</p>

  <p>Extra Credit: A beautiful and easy to use UI for your game (up to 10 pts). Beautiful means
    beautiful, or at least nice looking and easy to use.</p>

  <p>Submit: 1 html file and all JavaScript files used. Also, in the head of your html file, put a
    comment specifying which browser you used.</p>
